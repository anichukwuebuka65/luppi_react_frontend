## A social media applicaion  

Live site: https://luppi.vercel.app/login

This is a single page social media application where users can upload , delete and share posts,  
images, make comments on posts and also add friends just like facebook.

This backend application is also in my repository.

To run this app, simply clone the repository and run `npm start` to install dependencies,  
followed by `npm start`.
